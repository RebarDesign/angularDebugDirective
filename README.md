# angularDebugDirective
### A Directive used to Debugg JavaScript and AngularJS Applications

> GitHub repository: [https://github.com/RebarDesign/angularDebugDirective](https://github.com/RebarDesign/angularDebugDirective)

This project is used to scan all elements and identify scope property errors. 

## How to use

For the moment the debugging information apears in the console. 

The console will point out some misspellings, as well as the code line they are found in. Once you indentify the errors and fix them, the app should work fine :D 

## Future plans

* __[WIP]__ Add tests
* __[WIP]__ Use style to debug
* __[ONGOING]__ Improve code quality
* __[WIP]__ Add Gulp/Grunt workflows -- probably Gulp.
